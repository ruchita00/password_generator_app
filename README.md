# passwordgenerator

# to take the input from the user form have been used

# generate generatePassword function taking the 4 different props and based on that it is deciding the pattern of password and by iterating interchanging the position of the characters by doing random number as index.

# Finally password is returning to the handleSubmit function where storing inside local state and localstorage to persist the data.

# handleCopy method copy the password to the clipboard

# 95% things tried to keep html,css and javascript only not any library.

# for copy into the clipboard i have used react-copy-to-clipboard library.

# for icon also i have used @mui/icons-material library. 



# Due to lack of time i have used inline css
